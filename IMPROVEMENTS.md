# Cover Letter Agent Improvements

## Overview
This document summarizes the improvements made to the cover letter writing agent system based on user feedback and requirements.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Length Control and Conciseness
**Problem**: The first agent (CompanyResearchAgent) generated overly long content with repetitive statements and buzzwords.

**Solution**:
- Rewrote system prompt with strict length limits (60 words per section)
- Added explicit instructions to avoid generic buzzwords
- Implemented concise formatting requirements (2-3 sentences max per section)
- Prohibited phrases like "cutting-edge", "innovative solutions", "passionate about"

**Files Modified**:
- `agents/company_research_agent.py`

### 2. Intelligent Experience Matching
**Problem**: The system used all 3 experiences instead of selecting the most relevant 2 based on company type.

**Solution**:
- Reorganized project descriptions in `user_profile.py` with category tags
- Implemented company type detection logic (technical_research vs product)
- Added smart project selection:
  - Technical research companies: "algorithm_research" + "agent_development"
  - Product companies: "agent_development" + "news_dashboard"
- Limited output to exactly 2 experiences as requested

**Files Modified**:
- `user_profile.py`
- `agents/experience_matching_agent.py`

### 3. Clear Paragraph Structure
**Problem**: Generated text was one large block without clear section separation.

**Solution**:
- Modified DocumentAssemblyAgent to ensure 5-paragraph structure
- Implemented clear paragraph breaks: opening → experience1 → experience2 → cultural_fit → closing
- Added paragraph parsing logic to separate experience sections
- Updated polish prompt to maintain paragraph structure

**Files Modified**:
- `agents/document_assembly_agent.py`

### 4. Word Download Solution
**Problem**: Word document generation/download was not working properly.

**Solution**:
- Maintained existing python-docx Word generation
- Added Markdown output as backup option
- Implemented pandoc conversion as fallback for Markdown-to-Word
- Both Word and Markdown files are now generated simultaneously

**Files Modified**:
- `agents/document_assembly_agent.py`

## Technical Details

### Company Type Detection Algorithm
The system now analyzes job descriptions and titles using keyword scoring:

```python
research_indicators = ["research", "scientist", "algorithm", "optimization", ...]
product_indicators = ["product", "engineer", "developer", "deployment", ...]
```

### Project Selection Logic
- **Technical Research**: algorithm_research + agent_development
- **Product**: agent_development + news_dashboard
- **Both cases**: agent_development is always included as it's versatile

### Length Control Implementation
- System prompt: Maximum word limits per section
- User prompt: Specific sentence count requirements
- Polish prompt: Maintains conciseness while improving flow

## Files Changed
1. `agents/company_research_agent.py` - Length control and conciseness
2. `agents/experience_matching_agent.py` - Smart experience selection
3. `agents/document_assembly_agent.py` - Paragraph structure and Markdown output
4. `user_profile.py` - Reorganized project descriptions
5. `todo.md` - Task tracking (new file)
6. `IMPROVEMENTS.md` - This documentation (new file)

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with technical research job descriptions (should select algorithm + agent projects)
2. Test with product-oriented job descriptions (should select agent + news dashboard projects)
3. Verify paragraph structure in generated letters
4. Check both Word and Markdown output generation
5. Validate length constraints are respected

## Future Enhancements
- Add more sophisticated company type detection using NLP
- Implement dynamic length adjustment based on job requirements
- Add more project categories for better matching
- Integrate with more document conversion tools
